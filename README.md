# suicide-data-clustering
Suicides is a major issue in the world.
The dataset from kaggle on suicide dataset can provide insights on the reasons that cause it.
I have started to first cluster the data based on the total suicides and total population of the country. This helps us to differentiate high suicidal countries against low suicide rates countries.
This is a project in R
